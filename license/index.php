<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Use of the name "PHP"</h3>

<p>
    <strong>Q.</strong> I've written a project in PHP that I'm going to release as open source, and I'd like to call it
    PHPTransmogrifier. Is that OK?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>A.</strong> We really cannot stop you from using PHP in the name of your project, but we would prefer you
    come up with your own name independent of the PHP name.
</p>

<p>
    "PHP" is the PHP project's unique brand. When others see the name "PHP," they associate it with this project. When
    you use "PHP" as part of your software's name, you are linking your efforts to those of the entire PHP development
    community and the years of work that have gone into the PHP project.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, using "PHP" in your project's name causes a lot of confusion, making it more difficult for people to
    find your project or get help with it. Inevitably, people looking for your project will open issues on the PHP
    project's issue tracker, taking up the valuable time of our volunteers.
</p>

<p>
    So, please, pick a name that stands on its own merits. If others find your project useful, it will not take long to
    establish a reputation for yourself.
</p>

<h3>Change in licensing from PHP 9 and later</h3>

<p>
    <strong>Q.</strong> What are the differences between the PHP License, version 3.01, and the PHP License, version 4?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>A.</strong> The PHP License, version 4 removes clauses 4, 5, and 6 of the PHP License, version 3.01. This
    effectively makes it identical to the Modified BSD License (<code>BSD-3-Clause</code>).
</p>

<p>
    While the OSI approved versions 3.0 and 3.01 of the PHP License through their legacy approval process, the licenses
    were not compatible with the GPL. Additionally, some of the wording in clauses 4, 5, and 6 was challenging or
    impossible to enforce, and various readings and interpretations sometimes caused confusion among distributors.
    As a result, the PHP Group decided to invoke clause 5 of the PHP License to publish a new version. The new version
    resolves all problems with the PHP License (perceived or actual) while preserving the rights granted by
    contributors and the rights granted to users.
</p>

<h3>Change in licensing from PHP 4 and later</h3>

<p>
    <strong>Q.</strong> Why are PHP versions 4 and later not dual-licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL)
    like PHP 3?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>A.</strong> GPL enforces many restrictions on what can and cannot be done with the licensed code. The PHP
    developers decided to release PHP 4 under a much more permissive license (BSD-style), to allow broader uses of PHP
    by more people.
